# PokeGame
work in progress iterations of my Python game. each file has plans for what will be added in the new iteration.

Official Demo Notes - ver 0.9 of PokeGame allows both the enemy and user to choose between two moves each for battling
  - Each move is unique with different damage and effects. damage moves have missed hit and critical hit factors
  - user is disadvantaged if they were to select an invalid move or the 'help' command for their turn.
  - Future renditions may include, swappable characters for the user, items, and rematch method
